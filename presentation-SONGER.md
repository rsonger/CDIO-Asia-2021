<!-- Welcome to my keynote talk about Passion or Purpose, the challenges of student motivation in the new normal. -->
<!-- Given how drastically the way we teach classes has changed over the last year and a half, the question of what keeps students persisting through the associated troubles is a salient one. -->
<!-- In this talk, I would like to discuss what I view are the two core motivations in a student's life: passion and purpose. -->

# About International College of Technology
# <br>

### Mission: To Foster Global Innovators
- 5-year High School and Junior College level CDIO-based STEAM Education
- Students transfer to university at 3rd-year level after graduation

### Department of Science and Technology
- Integrated engineering experiences in first three years
- Specialized engineering tracks from 4th year

<!-- Now my school is not like a typical institute of higher education. Our students join from the age of 15 and study with us for 5 years in a CDIO-based STEAM education. After that, most of them graduate and transfer to a 4-year university at the 3rd-year level. -->
<!-- So my students begin their path towards engineering at a considerably younger age than that of other prospective engineering students.-->
<!-- For this reason, I have seen many students who are not entirely sure they want to have a career in engineering from the beginning and it has created numerous struggles for them. -->
<!-- This is the background from which I have prepared today's talk. -->

# School Closures 
## In April, 2020
**1.25 million** affected
**71.8%** of all learners
###### UNESCO, [Education: From Response to Recovery](https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse). Accessed October, 2021.

<!-- Now, it is well-known that the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 resulted in numerous school closures around the globe. -->
<!-- In April, the number of simultaneous closures was at its peak with over 1.25 million students being affected by their schools closing either fully or partially. That's 71.8% of all the learners around the world. -->
<!-- Although schools were closing, they refused to close down entirely as most schools switched to some form of remote or online approach to running classes. -->

# EdTech to the Rescue

Digital technology revolutionizing education:
- Online learning platforms
- Learning analytics tools in educational apps
- Access to high quality materials
- Free or low-cost information and knowledge
- Online communities of experts

<!-- Fortunately, the educational technology for learning from a distance has been available for many years and improved over time. -->
<!-- Various internet and software technologies have made high quality educational materials, the information and knowlege they embody, as well as the experts of each respective field available for free or at a low-cost to anyone ambitious enough to seek them out. -->
<!-- In addition, educational software as become more sophisticated with integrated learning analytics features that provide personalized insights for both the learner as well as the teacher. -->
<!-- But the mere existence of these technologies is not enough to solve the issue of school closures for all students. -->

---

# The "Digital Divide" (1)

Socioeconomic factors influence ***access*** and ***usage*** of emerging technologies.

Affluent schools are more likely to:
- Provide computers/tablets for students to use
- Use computers for modeling/simulation activities vs. drills/practice
- Apply **free** web tools for collaborative problem solving & new media literacy

Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) participants are mostly college-educated.
MOOC completion rates modestly correlate with educational attainment levels.

<!-- Different schools, different communities, even different can countries have different levels of access and usage of these revolutionary technologies and that is due to various socieconomic factors. -->
<!-- Of course, affluent schools are more likely affort the cost of providing technologies like computers and tablets to their students, but the digital divide goes beyond just the availability of financial resources. -->
<!-- Affluent schools with easy access to computer technologies are more likely to use it for higher level cognitive activities such as modeling and simulation compared to rote drilling and practice in less privileged schools. -->
<!-- Even when money is no issue as is the case with free tools available onine, such tools are more likely used in lessons for collaborative problem solving and new media literacies at schools that are already better off. -->
<!-- Another telling fact about this "digital divide" is that the majority of Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) participants are mostly already college educated. So merely opening up college-level materials to the world has not allowed more people to become college educated. Rather, the already-educated have become more educated because of it. -->

---

# The "Digital Divide" (2)

Hansen and Reich examined socioeconomic status (SES) of HarvardX and MITx students.
(SES includes parents education level, neighborhood income, and neighborhood education)
- MOOC students were mostly from high-SES neighborhoods
- Certificate completion rates were highest for high-SES students as well
- These patterns were particularly strong among adolescents

> "Closing gaps with digital learning resources requires targeting innovation towards the students most in need of additional support and opportunity."

###### Hansen, J. D., and Reich, J. (2015). Democratizing Education? Examining Access and Usage Patterns in Massive Open Online Courses. Science, 350(6265), 1245-1248. DOI: [10.1126/science.aab3782](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aab3782)

<!-- A study at Harvard analyzed the data of participants in HarvardX and MITx online courses, and it found that both levels of participation and completion rates could be predicted by the socioeconomic status of students, such as the the educational levels of their parents and the average income of their neighborhoods. -->
<!-- This study reinforces the point that online and remote technologies for increasing access to learning are serving those who don't necessarily need easier access and failing to provide additional support and opportunity for students who are most in need. -->

# The "EdTech Matthew Effect"

> "For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken away from them." Matthew 13:12

[Justin Reich](https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/justin-reich/) describes the digital divide as more of a "digital fault line":

1. Technology embeds systems of inequality rather than disrupting them.
2. Free tech benefits those who can take advantage of it rather than those in need.
3. Social and cultural ***exclusion*** is more powerful than access to technology.

###### Reich, J. (2020). Failure to Disrupt: Why Technology Alone Can’t Transform Education. Harvard University Press, 2020

<!-- The Director of the Teaching Systems Lab at MIT, Justin Reich, has done a lot of research into educational technology and he calls this phenomenon the "EdTech Matthew Effect". The name comes from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible which says that whoever has will be given more to the point of abundance; whereas, those who have not, what they do have will be taken away from them. -->
<!-- He elaborates on the points he believes are reasons why the digital divide will only get bigger over time. -->
<!-- The first is that technology is developed within cultural contexts that have inherent systems of inequality, and so those systems will similarly be embedded in the technological systems as well. -->
<!-- The second is that people who have the means to take advantage of free technologies are not always the same as the people who are in need of it. -->
<!-- The third is that various forms of social exclusion create much stronger barriers to entry than any other forms of exclusion such as lack of to the technology itself. -->

# Example:<br> Social Identity Threat

Fear of being seen as less capable based on one's race, gender, nationality, status, etc.

Low **persistence** and **completion rates** for MOOC students from less-developed countries† can be mitigated with "social belonging interventions".

##### † According to the [United Nations Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)

###### Kizilcec, R. F., Saltarelli, A. J., Reich, J., and Cohen, G. L. (2017). Closing global achievement gaps in MOOCs. Science, 355(6322), 251–52. DOI: [10.1126/science.aag2063](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2063)

<!-- As an example, let's look at "social identity threat" which is the fear of being seen as less capable than others because of the group you belong to. -->
<!-- MOOC participants from less-developed countries (according to the United Nations Human Development Index) are less likely to complete an online course than their counterparts in more-developed countries. -->
<!-- Researchers experimented with what they called "social belonging interventions" in the form of brief reflection activities for students to complete at the start of online courses. They then followed the activities of the students through to the end. -->
<!-- The researchers found that, in courses with the social belonging interventions, the students from less-developed countries performed as well as students from more-developed countries; whereas, courses without the intervention continued to see a gap. -->
<!-- These interventions were short writing assignments designed to acknowledge the feeling that one does not belong in the course and to let students hear testimonials from other students that had overcome those feelings. -->
<!-- The researchers concluded that "Psychological and learning sciences can can help turn an accessible educational experience into an equitable one." -->

# Passion or Purpose?

Factors of engagement include student-perceived **value of outcome** and **cost to engage**.
|  | Passion | Purpose |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| **Value of <br>Outcome** | - Personal interest & enjoyment<br>- Mastery, growth and learning<br>- Building self-efficacy | - Sense of identity/self-worth<br>- Status and recognition<br>- Contribution to family/society |
| **Cost of <br>Engagement** | - Boredom and irrelevance<br>- Mistakes hurt self-confidence | - Experience of social exclusion<br>- Wasted time on little progress |

- **Approach Motivation**: When the perceived **value** outweighs the **cost** 
- **Avoidance Motivation**: When the perceived **cost** outweighs the **value** 

<!-- Now, social exclusion is such a powerful obstacle precisely because it undermines an individual's  motivation, which brings us to the central point of this talk. -->
<!-- While other forms of exclusion can be more obvious, social exclusion presents an obstacle through the psychological burden it places on the individual experiencing it, which in turn increases their perceived cost of engagement on task. -->
<!-- In the literature we often see motivation expressed in terms of approach motivation and avoidance motivation where each can be defined by whether or not the achievement value outweighs its cost. In this talk, I would like to focus on the source of those perceptions, whether they stem from the individual's interests and enjoyment, or their sense of identity and responsibility to society. -->
<!-- An individual motivated by passion would pursue an endeavor for reason related to pleasure or learning and they would avoid a task if they expect to feel bored or see it as a threat to their self-confidence. -->
<!-- On the other hand, an individual motivated by purpose would pursue endeavors that resonate with their self-identity or provide some benefit to their social group, and they would avoid a task that makes them feel alien within the social context or provides little gain towards their larger goals. -->

---

# Cultural Models of Motivation

**Independent model of motivation** in individualistic "Western" societies
- Achievement is higher in students with stronger interest, enjoyment, and confidence
- Motivated by personal interests and enjoyment, ***PASSION***
  
**Interdependent model of motivation** in collectivistic "Eastern" societies
- Achievement is higher for students with strong connections to supportive others
- Motivated by social contribution and expectation, ***PURPOSE***

<!-- We can see cultural differences in the way societies encourage these different forms of motivation. -->
<!-- In individualistic societies, it is believed that students with stronger insterests, enjoyment, and confidence for a subject will have greater achievements in their studies. So, the locus of motivation is within the individual based on their interests or passion. -->
<!-- In more collectivistic societies, the belief is that students with more social connections and better relationships with supportive others will have higher achievements. Here the source of motivation is in the expectations of the people around the individual and their obligation to not to disappoint close friends or family. -->
<!-- If passion is a strong Western concept, then we can say purpose as its counterpart in Eastern societies. And in fact, this has been directly studied in recent research. -->

---

# Predicting Achievement from Passion

Li et al. found passion was less of a predictor for achievement in collectivistic societies than in Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies.
- The role of passion should not be overemphasized in diverse learning environments.
- Researchers need measures of interdependent motivation for collectivistic cultures:
  - Perceived norms in the classroom
  - Sense of belonging
  - Responsibility to one's family

###### Li, X. Han, M., Cohen, G. L., Markus, H. R. (2021). Passion matters but not equally everywhere: Predicting achievement from interest, enjoyment, and efficacy in 59 societies. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Mar 2021, 118 (11) e2016964118; DOI: [10.1073/pnas.2016964118](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016964118)

<!-- Researchers at Stanford University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong analyzed PISA datasets from 2009 to 2015. (PISA is the Program for International Student Assessmeent by the OECD, or Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. It measures the mathematics, science, and reading performance of 15-year old students around the world.) -->
<!-- These datasets from 59 societies included about half of what they called WEIRD societies: Western, educated, industrilized, rich and democratic. -->
<!-- Using variables in the PISA dataset of "interest", "enjoyment", and "efficacy" to measure student passion, they discovered that passion was a greater predictor of achievement and also explained greater variance in achievement by 37% compared to 16% in collectivisitic societies. -->
<!-- In collectivistic societies, parental emotional support was a better predictor than passion, which suggests a stronger orientation towards social purpose as a source of motivation. -->

# Motivation in Educational Psychology

Carol Ames' **Achievement Goal Theory** describes how students engage with a task.
- **Task orientation** focuses on completing some task to the best of one's ability.
  - Associated with positive cognitive, affective, and behavioural outcomes
- **Ego orientation** focuses on one's performance relative to that of others.
  - Outcomes suffer when perceived competence is low

The *motivational climate* provides clues for students to orient themselves.

###### Ames, C. (1992). Achievement goals and the classroom motivational climate. In D. H. Schunk & J. L. Meece (Eds.), Student perceptions in the classroom (pp. 327–348). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

<!-- In educational psychology, we can see parallels to passion and purpose with Achievement Goal Theory in the way it describes student engagement on task. But I view passion and purpose as a kind of macro-motivation embedded in the social context, or the motivational climate, of school and society. -->
<!-- A student driven by passion might put forth effort to have fun or develop their skills. On the other hand, a student driven by purpose would do so because they have expectations to meet for themselves or others. -->
<!-- In this sense, passion and purpose describe WHY a student is involved in a task, while Achievement Goal Theory describes HOW. -->
<!-- How they engage is reflected in the dialog surrounding the task such as the types and levels of goals being pursued, the nature of feedback given to the student, evaluation criteria for judging the accomplishment of a goal, and the way the accomplishment is recognized. This dialog can focus on the task itself or on the individual's ability. -->
<!-- For example, in Japanese culture, there is a strong emphasis on doing one's best (頑張る) -->
<!-- In situations where other cultures will say "Good luck!", the Japanese say "Do your best!" and personal satisfaction is often derived from the effort, regardless of the outcome. -->
<!-- Even when a student is not able to achieve a desired goal, they are reassured that they put in their best effort. -->
<!-- Of course this can vary greatly between individuals, not just societies. People who are more competitive in nature will likely be more ego involved in tasks where their performance is compared to others. -->

---

# Passion, not Obsession (1)

Institutes of higher education must handle two competing objectives:
Promoting holistic learning and accrediting student accomplishments

The role of grades is influenced by **cultural assumptions**:
- Favorable evaluation motivates students to work harder.
- Grading is a fair, reliable, and objective system for measuring accomplishments.
- Students and teachers must be accountable for proof of achievements.

<!-- This brings me to highlight one of the issues that institutes of higher education naturally must deal which is the contention between two competing objectives: promoting authentic learning and giving grades to assess students -->
<!-- A highly competitive university for example may put a stronger emphasis on the role of grades in order to distinguish their students further. -->
<!-- The degree to which grades play a role in learning is influenced by cultural assumptions about grades and assessment. -->
<!-- These cultural assumptions may come from either the culture of the society or the culture of the school, but they may not always be true. -->
<!-- For example, a student who consistently receives good grades may become confident in their ability and not put in as much effort as a result. Or grading systems may have inherent biases that favor one type of student over another. -->

---

# Passion, not Obsession (2)

**Student grades obsession**: extreme ego-oriented achievement driven by extrinsic rewards.

Students may be under pressure to perform for various reasons:
- To achieve qualifications (i.e., scholarships)
- To improve employability
- To live up to the expectations of one's teachers, parents, and/or self

Consequences include anxiety, cheating, a malformed self-concept, intellectual dependency on teacher approval, and undermined intrinsic motivation to learn.

<!-- Ultimately, putting a strong emphasis on the role of grades or overinflating their value may result in grade obsession among students. -->
<!-- When grades are strongly tied to scholarships, the perceived employability of students, or the expectations of close others, there is a danger that the student will forget the purpose of school as a place of learning. -->
<!-- And obsession over the pursuit of grades can have terrible consequences such as hurting their self-concept as a learner, making them dependent on the teacher to tell them what knowledge is allowed, or undermining the intrinsic pleasure of learning new things. -->
<!-- This is why a sense of passion and purpose is necessary for students who may feel like they are caught in an absurd rat race when their grades seem to have little meaning outside the school system in which they were awarded. -->
<!-- <pause> -->
<!-- But even in meaninglessness there is hope. To that point, I want to introduce you to the Myth of Sysiphus... -->

![bg contrast:130% right:48% cover](images/sysiphus.png)

# The Myth of Sysiphus

***The Absurd***:
We struggle to understand our purpose in a world that offers no answers.
Repetition is meaningless as it gets us nowhere.

***The Antidote***:
The lack of a *given meaning* in life invites us to master an *interpreted meaning*.
Iterating over things gives new perspective each time.

<!-- The French philosopher Albert Camus believed that in a world with no clear meaning or purpose, we must conquer our own fates. -->
<!-- In his famous essay 'The Myth of Sysiphus', he describes a mythological figure who becomes a hero of his own absurd situation. -->
<!-- Sysiphus was a man who lived with such great love and passion for life, he tricked the gods twice in order to cheat death. -->
<!-- As a result, the gods condemned him to an eternity pushing a boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again. -->
<!-- According to Camus, Sysiphus rises above his punishment by facing the absurdity of it and realizing its inherent meaninglessness. -->
<!-- Doing so frees him from the drudgery, allowing him to create his own meaning and rediscover a passion in the activity. -->
<!-- So the lack of inherent meaning in things allows us to define our own purpose and become truly happy in our pursuits. -->
<!-- Camus argues that even though Sisyphus is trapped in a repetitive structure, it is within that structure that he is free.  -->
<!-- To quote, “His fate belongs to him. His rock is his thing. . . he knows himself to be the master of his days.” -->
<!-- This reminds me of a Japanese phrase "Ichi-go Ichi-e" (一期一会) which means that no two moments are exactly the same--each exact moment can never be repeated--and so we should cherish each moment as a once-in-a-lifetime experience. -->
<!-- I think this is beautiful in the way that it speaks to our own agency for choosing a sense of purpose. If the world will not give us meaning, then we are free to make of it what we will and find it in that which is most important to us. -->

# "Do What You Love" (DWYL) Advocation

Assumptions behind DWYL advice for students:
- All students have the potential to be successful if they just find their passion and work hard at it.
- Everybody has multiple career options and full agency regarding the direction of their career.
- All work should serve a passion or eventually evolve to that point.

###### Stebleton, M. J. (2019). Moving Beyond Passion: Why “Do What You Love” Advice for College Students Needs Reexamination, Journal of College and Character, 20(2), 163-171. DOI: [10.1080/2194587X.2019.1591289](https://doi.org/10.1080/2194587X.2019.1591289)<br> Photo Credit: Linda A. Cicero/Stanford News Service

<!-- Steve Jobs spoke about pursuing one's passion in his 2005 commencement address at Standford University when he told the graduates to find what they love. -->
<!-- This idea of doing what you love is viewed as the golden key that unlocks a happy and successful life and career, especially in American culture which strongly follows an independent model of motivation. -->
<!-- While this is great advice as I previously mentioned about how passion is necessary, it only covers half of the picture. For many, building a sense of purpose is a much more practical endeavor than discovering a one true passion. -->
<!-- This is because students who view pursuing passion as inherently individualistic and privileged may respond better to an idealistic purpose that emphasizes a collective meaning. -->
<!-- In addition, the amount of time and freedom to explore one's career options may not be available to students who have limited resources, student debt, or obligations towards family. -->
<!-- And students may not be fully aware of the messages and circumstances influencing their decisions either. For them, it may be worthwhile to reflect on their values, skills, and knowlege about future prospects in an effort to better understand their interests, but discoverying a "one true passion" is simply not necessary depending on the social contexts of their lives. -->

# Finding Passion Vs. Developing Passion

### Fixed Mindset
Students who believe their interests to be fixed:
- are less engaged with topics outside their existing interests,
- believe passion provides limitless motivation with no difficulties, and
- disengage faster when potentially new interests become difficult.

### Growth Mindset
Students approach subjects with more enthusiasm and persistence when they believe personal interests can be developed like a skill.

###### O'Keefe, P. A., Dweck, C. S., and Walton, G. M. (2018). Implicit Theories of Interest: Finding Your Passion or Developing It? Psychological Science 2018, 29(10), 1653–1664. DOI: [10.1177/0956797618780643](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618780643)

<!-- Even in terms of pursuing a passion, there are nuances around how one my go about doing so. -->
<!-- A group of researchers decided to examine mindsets for implicit theories of interest. They included Carol Dweck, who is the American Psychologist famous for her theory of intelligence on fixed vs. growth mindsets. -->
<!-- They performed five studies that examined how students with a fixed mindset approached various situations related to their interests and compared them to students with a growth mindset. -->
<!-- Here, a fixed mindset views interests as a kind of fixed trait that doesn't change whereas a growth mindset sees interest as something that can be developed through effort. -->
<!-- From the results of these studies, we can see evidence that having a fixed mindset is like an making an identity statement about oneself and one's abilities. The growth mindset, on the other hand, reflects a greater resilience towards gaining new interests and maintaining existing ones in the face of difficulty. And since interest is strongly connected to intrinsic motivation, this research suggests that promoting a growth mindset would serve to benefit the well-being of students through improved motivation. -->

---

# Exploration in STEM

An openness to exploration has shown better motivation, retention, and cost perceptions for students in STEM majors.

- **Exploratory identity status**: students seek out information and reflect on it
- **Normative identity status**: students are committed to perceptions of self

###### Perez, T., Cromley, J. G., and Kaplan, A. (2014). The role of identity development, values, and costs in college STEM retention. Journal of Educational Psychology, 106(1), 315–329. DOI: [10.1037/a0034027](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0034027)

<!-- Now, a student's mindset may reflect a deeper degree of their exploration or committment to a personal identity. -->
<!-- To say someone has a growth mindset suggests they are open to new information and can apply it to their way of thinking regarding identity-relevant tasks. In other words, they are said to have an exploratory identity status. -->
<!-- On the other hand, a fixed mindset may reflect a committment to the idea that one has certain traits and abilities which do not change, which reflects a normative identity status. -->
<!-- Relevant to these ideas, researchers in another study have shown that students with an exploratory attitude towards STEM subjects also have greater perceptions of competence and value for the subject. This in turn increases the retention rates of these students for the subject. -->
<!-- On the other hand, a lack of exploration was shown to be related to lower self-confidence and a greater sense of cost in terms of effort or psychological burden for engaging in the STEM subject. Those students were also more likely to say they were thinking of leaving STEM studies altogether. -->

---

# Summary of Concepts

* Passion as a source of motivation is connected to individual interests; whereas, purpose is connected to feelings of social belonging.
* Both passion and purpose are encouraged by social and cultural factors in a student's life with passion being a greater predictor for achievement in individualistic societies.
* Passion and purpose can fulfill our needs for intrinsic meaning while living in a silent, repetitive world.
* Students who persist in their studies have greater confidence, are more open to new experiences, and have a higher potential for intrinsic motivation in their pursuits.

<!-- In the last few slides, I would like to introduce a couple of real-world examples. But before I do that, let's quickly summarize the concepts discussed so far. -->

# The Case of Afaf:<br> Purpose Guides Passion

**Afaf Alaa**
2nd year student 
International College of Technology

**Video Producer** and **Contestant**
[Space Debris - Breakthrough Junior Challenge 2021](https://youtu.be/TvXXeqMk_9c)

:arrow_right: A strict goal helped her to explore her interests.

<!-- Now the first case I would like introduce is that of Afaf Alaa. -->
<!-- Afaf is a member of the Design and Fabrication Club at International College of Technology where students are allowed to work on projects of their own choosing. -->
<!-- She enjoyed the freedom to work on whatever she liked, but had difficulty narrowing down her many interests. -->
<!-- She wanted to learn about video editing but thought that studying it on its own would be boring, so Afaf joined a competition in order to have a deadline that would motivate her to work. She joined the Breakthrough Junior Challenge contest where teenagers compete by producing a 3-minute video that communicates some scientific concept. -->
<!-- Afaf created her own original video that discussed the problem of space debris, including the concepts of gravity, momentum and orbit. -->
<!-- Joining the competition gave her a purpose which she followed by creating a Gantt chart to plan out the process of choosing a topic, scripting it, filming and editing the final video. -->
<!-- And it did not matter to her whether she became a finalist in the challenge. She was happy with the final product and full of pride from all the positive feedback she got from her teachers and friends. -->
<!-- Passion alone was not enough for Afaf. She oriented herself towards a purposeful goal and achieved a satisfying outcome. -->

# The Case of Tokido:<br> Passion Drives Purpose 

**Hajime "Tokido" Taniguchi**
University of Tokyo
Graduate School of Engineering, 2010

**Competitive Fighting Game Champion**
Approx. Total Winnings: $585,359

:arrow_right: Found renewed purpose in his passion for games.

###### Photo Credit: [TOPANGA](https://www.openrec.tv/live/ovrdx3egy8j)

<!-- The next case is that of Hajime Taniguchi, better known as Tokido. -->
<!-- Tokido was driven by his studies in school and strongly focused on his undergraduate research at the University of Tokyo. -->
<!-- He always approaches tasks not by asking "why?", but instead by setting a goal for himself and finding the most efficient way to proceed. Following this approach in his research gave him a purpose as he was developing artifical bones and organs for humans. He felt like he was contributing to society and even won a national award for his capstone research paper. -->
<!-- But this heavy focus on his research meant that he did not study for graduate school exams and as a result, he could not score high enough to get into the graduate lab that he wanted. -->
<!-- The lab he ended up in was not a good fit for him and he quickly became unsatisfied not being able to contribute to their work. -->
<!-- At that time, the pro gaming industry was growing rapidly and he saw other fighters of lower skill gaining recognition. -->
<!-- So after graduating, he decided to follow his passion for games and reimagined his purpose to become the world's top fighting game champion. -->
<!-- When Tokido faultered and lost a sense of purpose, his passion drove him to discover a new one. -->

# Take Away Advice for Addressing Motivation

* Foster a sense of belonging by explicitly centralizing diverse perspectives
* Establish clear expectations and norms without undermining personal autonomy
* Apply grading to promote self-reflection/formative assessments  
* Cultivate a growth mindset for both learning and interest
* Consider reflection activities that relate subject matter to students' sense of purpose
* Maintain a balance between language of passion and language of purpose

<!-- Finally, I would like to leave you with some advice based on the discussion here today which I think every teacher can implement in their own classes. -->
<!-- First is to recognize that cultural differences also affect motivational differences. We should foster a sense of belonging among our students. -->
<!-- Second, create a motivational context by communicating what is expected of the students as they engage on task. -->
<!-- Next is to help students focus on the learning side of assessment through self-reflection and formative feedback. -->
<!-- Remind your students that interests as well as intelligence can be developed like a skill. -->
<!-- If possible, give opportunities for self-reflection into one's interests, values, skills, occupational knowledge, and the future of work with the goal of discovering a self-purpose. This could especially serve students who have a limited ideas of their own possibilities. -->
<!-- Finally, use a balance of language for both passion and purpose when discussing motivation for assignments so your students can hopefully find something meaningful in whichever feels most appropriate for them at that time in their lives. -->
