<!-- Welcome to my keynote talk about Passion or Purpose, the challenges of student motivation in the new normal. -->
<!-- Given how drastically the way we teach classes has changed over the last year and a half, the question of what keeps students persisting through the associated troubles is a salient one. -->
<!-- In this talk, I would like to discuss what I view are the two core motivations in a student's life: passion and purpose. -->

# About International College of Technology
# <br>

### Mission: To Foster Global Innovators
- 5-year High School and Junior College level CDIO-based STEAM Education
- Students transfer to university at 3rd-year level after graduation

### Department of Science and Technology
- Integrated engineering experiences in first three years
- Specialized engineering tracks from 4th year

<!-- Now my school is not like a typical institute of higher education. Our students join from the age of 15 and study with us for 5 years in a CDIO-based STEAM education. After that, most of them graduate and transfer to a 4-year university at the 3rd-year level. -->
<!-- So my students begin their path towards engineering considerably younger than other prospective engineering undergrads do.-->
<!-- For this reason, I have seen many students who are not entirely sure they want to have a career in engineering from the beginning and it has created for them numerous struggles. -->
<!-- This is the background from which I have prepared today's talk. -->

# School Closures 
## In April, 2020
**1.25 million** affected
**71.8%** of all learners
###### UNESCO, [Education: From Response to Recovery](https://en.unesco.org/covid19/educationresponse). Accessed October, 2021.

<!-- It is well-known that the Coronavirus pandemic of 2020 resulted in numerous school closures around the globe. -->
<!-- In April, the number of simultaneous closures was at its peak with over 1.25 million students being affected by a school closure. That's 71.8% of all the learners around the world. -->
<!-- Although schools were closing, they refused to close down entirely as most schools switched to some form of remote or online approach to teaching classes. -->

# EdTech to the Rescue

Digital technology revolutionizing education:
- Online learning platforms
- Learning analytics tools in educational apps
- Access to high quality materials
- Free or low-cost information and knowledge
- Online communities of experts

<!-- Fortunately, the educational technology for learning from a distance has been available for many years and improved over time. -->
<!-- Various internet and software technologies have made high quality educational materials, information and knowlege, as well as the experts of each respective field available for free or low-cost to any ambitious enough to seek them out. -->
<!-- In addition, educational software as become more sophisticated with integrated learning analytics features that provide personalized insights to the learner as well as teachers. -->
<!-- But the mere existence of these technologies is not enough to solve the issue of school closures for all students. -->

---

# The "Digital Divide" (1)

Socioeconomic factors influence ***access*** and ***usage*** of emerging technologies.

Affluent schools are more likely to:
- Provide computers/tablets for students to use
- Use computers for modeling/simulation activities vs. drills/practice
- Apply **free** web tools for collaborative problem solving & new media literacy

Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) participants are mostly college-educated.
MOOC completion rates modestly correlate with educational attainment levels.

<!-- Different schools, different communities, even different can countries have different levels of access and usage of revolutionary technologies due to varying socieconomic factors. -->
<!-- Of course, affluent schools are more likely to be able to provide technology as computers and tablets to their students, but the digital divide goes beyond just the availability of financial resources. -->
<!-- Affluent schools with easy access to computer technologies are more likely to use it for higher level cognitive activities such as modeling and simulation compared to rote drilling and practice at less privileged schools. -->
<!-- Even when money is no issue as with free tools available onine, these are more likely applied to learning collaborative problem solving and new media literacies at schools that are already better off. -->
<!-- Another telling fact about this "digital divide" is that the majority of Massively Open Online Course (MOOC) participants are mostly already college educated. So merely opening up college-level materials to the world has not allowed more people to become college educated. Rather, the already-educated have become more educated because of it. -->

---

# The "Digital Divide" (2)

Hansen and Reich examined socioeconomic status (SES) of HarvardX and MITx students.
(SES includes parents education level, neighborhood income, and neighborhood education)
- MOOC students were mostly from high-SES neighborhoods
- Certificate completion rates were highest for high-SES students as well
- These patterns were particularly strong among adolescents

> "Closing gaps with digital learning resources requires targeting innovation towards the students most in need of additional support and opportunity."

###### Hansen, J. D., and Reich, J. (2015). Democratizing Education? Examining Access and Usage Patterns in Massive Open Online Courses. Science, 350(6265), 1245-1248. DOI: [10.1126/science.aab3782](https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aab3782)

<!-- A study at Harvard analyzed the data of participants in HarvardX and MITx online courses, and it found that both participation and completion could be predicted by student socioeconomic status such as the average income of their neighborhood and the educational levels of their parents. -->
<!-- This study reinforces the point that online and remote technologies for increasing access to learning are serving those who don't necessarily need easier access and failing to provide the additional support and opportunity for students who are most in need. -->

# The "EdTech Matthew Effect"

> "For whoever has will be given more, and they will have an abundance. Whoever does not have, even what they have will be taken away from them." Matthew 13:12

[Justin Reich](https://cmsw.mit.edu/profile/justin-reich/) describes the digital divide as more of a "digital fault line":

1. Technology embeds systems of inequality rather than disrupting them.
2. Free tech benefits those who can take advantage of it rather than those in need.
3. Social and cultural ***exclusion*** is more powerful than access to technology.

###### Reich, J. (2020). Failure to Disrupt: Why Technology Alone Can’t Transform Education. Harvard University Press, 2020

<!-- Justin Reich, who is Director of the Teaching Systems Lab at MIT, has done a lot of research into educational technology and he calls this phenomenon the "EdTech Matthew Effect". The name comes from a passage in the Gospel of Matthew in the Bible which says that whoever has will be given more to the point of abundance; whereas, those who have not, what they do have will be taken away from them. -->
<!-- He elaborates on the points he believes are reasons why the digital divide will only get bigger over time. -->
<!-- The first is that technology is developed within cultural contexts that have inherent systems of inequality, and so those systems will similarly be embedded in the technological systems as well. -->
<!-- The second is that people who have the means to take advantage of free technologies are not always the same as the people who are in need of it. -->
<!-- The third is various forms of social exclusion create much stronger barriers to entry than any other forms of restriction to the technology itself. -->

# Example:<br> Social Identity Threat

Fear of being seen as less capable based on one's race, gender, nationality, status, etc.

Low **persistence** and **completion rates** for MOOC students from less-developed countries† can be mitigated with "social belonging interventions".

##### † According to the [United Nations Human Development Index](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi)

###### Kizilcec, R. F., Saltarelli, A. J., Reich, J., and Cohen, G. L. (2017). Closing global achievement gaps in MOOCs. Science, 355(6322), 251–52. DOI: [10.1126/science.aag2063](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aag2063)

<!-- As an example, let's look at social identity threat which is the fear of being seen as less capable than others because of the group to which you belong. -->
<!-- MOOC participants from less-developed countries according to the United Nations Human Development Index are less likely to complete an online course than their counterparts in more-developed countries. -->
<!-- Researchers experimented with "social belonging interventions" as brief reflection activities at the start of online courses and then followed the activities of the students through to the end. -->
<!-- They found that, in courses with the social belonging interventions, the students from less-developed countries performed as well as students from more-developed countries; whereas, courses without the intervention continued to see a gap. -->
<!-- These interventions were short writing assignments designed to acknowledge the feeling that one does not belong in the course and hear testimonials from other students that had overcome those feelings. -->
<!-- The researches concluded that "Psychological and learning sciences can can help turn an accessible educational experience into an equitable one." -->

# Passion or Purpose?

Factors of engagement include student-perceived **value of outcome** and **cost to engage**.
|  | Passion | Purpose |
| :---: | --- | --- |
| **Value of <br>Outcome** | - Personal interest & enjoyment<br>- Mastery, growth and learning<br>- Building self-efficacy | - Sense of identity/self-worth<br>- Status and recognition<br>- Contribution to family/society |
| **Cost of <br>Engagement** | - Boredom and irrelevance<br>- Mistakes hurt self-confidence | - Experience of social exclusion<br>- Wasted time on little progress |

- **Approach Motivation**: When the perceived **value** outweighs the **cost** 
- **Avoidance Motivation**: When the perceived **cost** outweighs the **value** 

<!-- Now, social exclusion is such a powerful obstacle precisely because it undermines an individual's  motivation, which brings us to the central point of this talk. -->
<!-- While other forms of exclusion can be more obvious, social exclusion presents an obstacle through the psychological burden it places on the individual experiencing it, which in turn increases their perceived cost of engagement on task. -->
<!-- In the literature we often see motivation expressed in terms of approach motivation and avoidance motivation where each can be defined by whether or not the achievement value outweighs its cost. In this talk, I would like to focus on the source of those perceptions, whether they stem from the individual's interests and enjoyment, or their sense of identity and responsibility to society. -->
<!-- An individual motivated by passion would pursue an endeavor for reason related to pleasure or learning and they would avoid a task if they feel it would make them bored or hurt their confidence. -->
<!-- On the other hand, an individual motivated by purpose would pursue endeavors that resonate with their self-identity or provide some benefit to their social group, and they would avoid a task that makes them feel alien within the social context or provides little gain towards their larger goals. -->

---

# Cultural Models of Motivation

**Independent model of motivation** in individualistic "Western" societies
- Achievement is higher in students with stronger interest, enjoyment, and confidence
- Motivated by personal interests and enjoyment, ***PASSION***
  
**Interdependent model of motivation** in collectivistic "Eastern" societies
- Achievement is higher for students with strong connections to supportive others
- Motivated by social contribution and expectation, ***PURPOSE***

<!-- We can see cultural differences in the way societies encourage these different forms of motivation. -->
<!-- In individualistic societies, it is believed that students with stronger insterests, enjoyment, and confidence for a subject will have greater achievements in their studies. The locus of motivation is within the individual based on their interests or passion. -->
<!-- In more collectivistic societies, the belief is that students with more social connections and better relationships with supportive other will have higher achievements. Here the source of motivation is in the expectations of the people around the individual or their obligation not to disappoint close friends or family. -->
<!-- If passion is a strong Western concept, then I view purpose as its counterpart in Eastern societies. And this has recently been directly studied in research. -->

---

# Predicting Achievement from Passion

Li et al. found passion was less of a predictor for achievement in collectivistic societies than in Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD) societies.
- The role of passion should not be overemphasized in diverse learning environments.
- Researchers need measures of interdependent motivation for collectivistic cultures:
  * Perceived norms in the classroom
  * Sense of belonging
  * Responsibility to one's family

###### Li, X. Han, M., Cohen, G. L., Markus, H. R. (2021). Passion matters but not equally everywhere: Predicting achievement from interest, enjoyment, and efficacy in 59 societies. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences Mar 2021, 118 (11) e2016964118; DOI: [10.1073/pnas.2016964118](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2016964118)

<!-- Researchers at Stanford University and the Chinese University of Hong Kong analyzed PISA datasets from 2009 to 2015. (PISA is the Program for International Student Assessmeent by the OECD, or Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. It measures the mathematics, science, and reading performance of 15-year old students around the world.) -->
<!-- These datasets from 59 societies included about half of what they called WEIRD societies: Wester, educated, industrilized, rich and democratic. -->
<!-- Using the PISA dataset variables of "interest", "enjoyment", and "efficacy" to measure student passion, they discovered that passion was a greater predictor of achievement and explained greater variance in achievement by 37% compared to 16% in collectivisitic societies. -->
<!-- In collectivistic societies, parental emotional support was a better predictor than passion, which suggests a stronger orientation towards social purpose as a source of motivation. -->

# Motivation in Educational Psychology

Carol Ames' **Achievement Goal Theory** describes how students engage with a task.
- **Task orientation** focuses on completing some task to the best of one's ability.
  - Associated with positive cognitive, affective, and behavioural outcomes
- **Ego orientation** focuses on one's performance relative to that of others.
  - Outcomes suffer when perceived competence is low

The *motivational climate* provides clues for students to orient themselves.

###### Ames, C. (1992). Achievement goals and the classroom motivational climate. In D. H. Schunk & J. L. Meece (Eds.), Student perceptions in the classroom (pp. 327–348). Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.

<!-- In educational psychology, Achievement Goal Theory has parallels to passion and purpose in the way it describes student engagement on task. But I view passion and purpose as a kind of macro-motivation embedded in the social context, or motivational climate, of school and society. -->
<!-- A student driven by passion might put forth effort to have fun or develop their skills. On the other hand, a student driven by purpose would do so because they have expectations to meet for themselves or others. -->
<!-- In this sense, passion and purpose describe WHY a student is involved in a task, while Achievement Goal Theory describes HOW. -->
<!-- How they engage is reflected in the dialog surrounding the task (types and levels of goals, nature of feedback, evaluation criteria, and recognition of accomplishment) which can be focused on the task itself or on the individual's ability. -->
<!-- For example, in Japanese culture, there is a strong emphasis on doing one's best (頑張る) -->
<!-- In situations where other cultures will say "Good luck!", the Japanese say "Do your best!" and personal satisfaction is often derived from the effort, regardless of the outcome. -->
<!-- Even when a student is not able to achieve a desired goal, they are reassured that they put in their best effort. -->
<!-- Of course this can vary greatly between individuals, not just societies. People who are more competitive in nature will likely be more ego involved in tasks where their performance is compared to others. -->

---

# Passion, not Obsession (1)

Institutes of higher education must handle two competing objectives:
Promoting holistic learning and accrediting student accomplishments

The role of grades is influenced by **cultural assumptions**:
* Favorable evaluation motivates students to work harder.
* Grading is a fair, reliable, and objective system for measuring accomplishments.
* Students and teachers must be accountable for proof of achievements.

<!-- One of the issues that institutes of higher education naturally must deal with is a contention between two competing objectives: promoting authentic learning and assessing students with grades -->
<!-- A highly competitive university for example may put a stronger emphasis on the role of grades in order to distinguish their students. -->
<!-- The degree to which grades play a role in learning is influenced by cultural assumptions about grades and assessment. -->
<!-- These assumptions may come from either culture of the social context or the culture of the school, but they may not always be true. -->
<!-- For example, a student who consistently receives good grades may become confident in their ability and not put in as much effort as a result. Or grading systems may have inherent biases that favor one type of student over another. -->

---

# Passion, not Obsession (2)

**Student grades obsession**: extreme ego-oriented achievement driven by extrinsic rewards.

Students may be under pressure to perform for various reasons:
- To achieve qualifications (i.e., scholarships)
- To improve employability
- To live up to the expectations of one's teachers, parents, and/or self

Consequences include anxiety, cheating, a malformed self-concept, intellectual dependency on teacher approval, and undermined intrinsic motivation to learn.

<!-- Ultimately, putting a strong emphasis on the role of grades or overinflating their value may result in grade obsession among students. -->
<!-- When grades are strongly tied to scholarships, the perceived employability of the student, or the expectations of others, there is a danger that the student will forget the purpose of school as a place of learning. -->
<!-- And obsession over the pursuit of grades can hurt their self-concept as a learner, make them dependent on the teacher to tell them what knowledge is allowed, or undermine the intrinsic pleasure of learning new things. -->
<!-- This is why a sense of passion and purpose is necessary for students who may feel like they are caught in an absurd rat race when their grades seem to have little meaning outside the school system which conceived them. -->
<!-- But even in meaninglessness there is hope. To that point, I want to talk about the Myth of Sysiphus... -->

# The Myth of Sysiphus

***The Absurd***:
We struggle to understand our purpose in a world that offers no answers.
Repetition is meaningless as it gets us nowhere.

***The Antidote***:
The lack of a *given meaning* in life invites us to master an *interpreted meaning*.
Iterating over things gives new perspective each time.

<!-- The French philosopher Albert Camus believed that in a world with no clear meaning or purpose, we must conquer our own fates. -->
<!-- In his famous essay 'The Myth of Sysiphus', he describes a mythological figure who becomes a hero of his own absurd situation. -->
<!-- Sysiphus was a man who lived with such great love and passion for life, he tricked the gods twice in order to cheat death. -->
<!-- As a result, the gods condemned him to an eternity pushing a boulder up a hill only for it to roll back down again. -->
<!-- According to Camus, Sysiphus rises above his punishment by facing the absurdity of it and realizing its inherent meaninglessness. -->
<!-- Doing so frees him from the drudgery and allows him to create his own meaning and rediscover passion in the activity. -->
<!-- The lack of inherent meaning in things allows us to define our own purpose and become truly happy in our pursuits. -->
<!-- Camus argues that even though Sisyphus is trapped in a repetitive structure, within that structure he is free.  -->
<!-- “His fate belongs to him. His rock is his thing. . . he knows himself to be the master of his days.” -->
<!-- This reminds me of a phrase "Ichi-go Ichi-e" (一期一会) which means exact moments can never be repeated and so should be cherished as once-in-a-lifetime experiences. -->
<!-- I think this is beautiful precisely because it speaks to our own agency over our sense of purpose. If the world won't give us meaning for our lives, then we are free to make of it what we will and find it in that which is most important to us. -->

# "Do What You Love" (DWYL) Advocation

Assumptions behind DWYL advice for students:
* All students have the potential to be successful if they just find their passion and work hard at it.
* Everybody has multiple career options and full agency regarding the direction of their career.
* All work should serve a passion or eventually evolve to that point.

###### Stebleton, M. J. (2019). Moving Beyond Passion: Why “Do What You Love” Advice for College Students Needs Reexamination, Journal of College and Character, 20(2), 163-171. DOI: [10.1080/2194587X.2019.1591289](https://doi.org/10.1080/2194587X.2019.1591289)<br> Photo Credit: Linda A. Cicero/Stanford News Service

<!-- In his 2005 commencement address at Standford University, Steve Jobs spoke about pursuing one's passion when he told the graduates to find what they love. -->
<!-- Especially in America which follows an independent model of motivation, discovering one's passion is viewed as the golden key that unlocks a happy and successful life and career. -->
<!-- While this is great advice as we previously established that passion is necessary, it only covers half of the picture. For many, building a sense of purpose is a much more practical endeavor than discovering a one true passion. -->
<!-- This is because students who view passion as inherently individualistic and privileged may respond better to an idealistic purpose that emphasizes a collective meaning. -->
<!-- In addition, the amount of time and freedom to explore one's career options may not be available to students who have limited resources, student debt, or obligations towards family. -->
<!-- Students may not be fully aware of the messages and circumstances influencing their decisions either. It may be worthwhile for them to reflect on their values, skills, and knowlege about future prospects in an effort to pursue their interests, but discoverying a "true passion" is simply not necessary for many depending on the social context of their lives. -->

# Finding Passion Vs. Developing Passion

### Fixed Mindset
Students who believe their interests to be fixed:
- are less engaged with topics outside their existing interests,
- believe passion provides limitless motivation with no difficulties, and
- disengage faster when potentially new interests become difficult.

### Growth Mindset
Students approach subjects with more enthusiasm and persistence when they believe personal interests can be developed like a skill.

###### O'Keefe, P. A., Dweck, C. S., and Walton, G. M. (2018). Implicit Theories of Interest: Finding Your Passion or Developing It? Psychological Science 2018, 29(10), 1653–1664. DOI: [10.1177/0956797618780643](https://doi.org/10.1177/0956797618780643)

<!-- Even in terms of pursuing a passion, there are nuances around how one my go about doing so. -->
<!-- A band of researchers including Carol Dweck, who is the American Psychologist famous for her theory of intelligence on fixed vs. growth mindsets, decided to test mindsets for implicit theories of interest as well. -->
<!-- They performed five studies that examined students with a fixed mindset vs a growth mindset towards their interests. -->
<!-- This means that a fixed mindset views a person's interests as a kind of fixed trait that doesn't change whereas a growth mindset sees interests as something that can be developed through effort. -->
<!-- From the results of the studies, we can see evidence that the fixed mindset is like an identity statement that reflects how students view themselves and their own abilities. The growth mindset, on the other hand, reflects a greater resilience towards maintaining interests. And since interest is strongly connected to intrinsic motivation, this research suggests that promoting a growth mindset should serve to benefit the well-being of students through improved motivation. -->

---

# Exploration in STEM

An openness to exploration has shown better motivation, retention, and cost perceptions for students in STEM majors.

- **Exploratory identity status**: students seek out information and reflect on it
- **Normative identity status**: students are committed to perceptions of self

###### Perez, T., Cromley, J. G., and Kaplan, A. (2014). The role of identity development, values, and costs in college STEM retention. Journal of Educational Psychology, 106(1), 315–329. DOI: [10.1037/a0034027](https://doi.org/10.1037/a0034027)

<!-- Now, a student's mindset may reflect a deeper degree of their exploration or committment to a personal identity. -->
<!-- To say someone has a growth mindset suggests they are open to new information and can apply it to their way of thinking regarding identity-relevant tasks. -->
<!-- On the other hand, a fixed mindset may reflect a committment to ideas about oneself having certain traits and abilities. -->
<!-- Researchers in another study have shown that an exploratory attitude in STEM subjects is connected to having greater perceptions of competence and value for the subject while a lack of exploration is related to lower confidence and a greater sense of cost (effort, psychological burden) for engaging in STEM. -->
<!-- In the study, these factors also contributed to the retention rates of students in their STEM majors with exploratory status being connected to a higher likelihood to continue in the program. -->

---

# Summary of Concepts

* Passion as a source of motivation is connected to individual interests; whereas, purpose is connected to feelings of social belonging.
* Both passion and purpose are encouraged by social and cultural factors in a student's life with passion being a greater predictor for achievement in individualistic societies.
* Passion and purpose can fulfill our needs for intrinsic meaning while living in a silent, repetitive world.
* Students who persist in their studies have greater confidence, are more open to new experiences, and have a higher potential for intrinsic motivation in their pursuits.

<!-- Before introducing a couple of real-world examples, I would like to summarize the concepts we have discussed so far. -->

:arrow_right: A strict goal helped her to explore her interests.

<!-- The first case I would like introduce is that of Afaf Alaa -->
<!-- Afaf is a member of the Design and Fabrication Club at International College of Technology where students are allowed to work on projects of their own choosing. -->
<!-- She enjoyed the freedom to work on whatever she liked, but had difficulty narrowing down her many interests. -->
<!-- She wanted to learn about video editing but thought that studying it on its own would be boring, so Afaf joined a competition to have a deadline. She joined the Breakthrough Junior Challenge contest where teenagers produce a 3-minute video to communicate some concept in science. -->
<!-- The competition gave her a purpose which she followed by creating a Gantt chart to plan out the process of choosing a topic, scripting, filming and editing. -->
<!-- Passion alone was not enough for Afaf. She needed to orient herself towards a purposeful goal to be productive. -->

# The Case of Tokido:<br> Passion Drives Purpose 

**Hajime "Tokido" Taniguchi**

###### Photo Credit: [TOPANGA](https://www.openrec.tv/live/ovrdx3egy8j)

<!-- The next case is that of Hajime Taniguchi, better known as Tokido. -->
<!-- Tokido was driven by his studies and focused strongly on his research in school -->
<!-- His approach was not to ask "why?" when approaching a task, but instead to set a goal and find the most efficient way to proceed. He enjoyed this approach that emphasizes efficiency in his research which gave him a purpose developing artifical bones and organs because it made him feel like he was contributing to society. -->
<!-- He even won a national award for his capstone research thesis. -->
<!-- But this heavy focus on his research meant that he did not study for graduate school exams and as a result, he could not score high enough to get into the graduate lab that he wanted. -->
<!-- The lab he ended up in was not a good fit for him and he quickly became unsatisfied not being able to contribute to their work. -->
<!-- At that time, pro gaming was growing rapidly and he saw other fighters of lower skill gaining recognition. -->
<!-- So after graduating, he decided to follow his passion for games and reimagined his purpose to become the world's top fighting game champion. -->
<!-- When Tokido faultered and lost a sense of purpose, his passion drove him to discover a new one. -->

# Take Away Advice for Addressing Motivation

* Foster a sense of belonging by explicitly centralizing diverse perspectives
* Establish clear expectations and norms without undermining personal autonomy
* Apply grading to promote self-reflection/formative assessments  
* Cultivate a growth mindset for both learning and interest
* Consider reflection activities that relate subject matter to students' sense of purpose
* Maintain a balance between language of passion and language of purpose

<!-- Finally, I would like to offer some advice based on the discussion here today which I think every teacher can implement in their own classes. -->
<!-- First is to recognize that cultural differences also affect motivational differences. We should foster a sense of belonging among our students. -->
<!-- Create a motivational context by communicating what is expected of the students as they engage on task. -->
<!-- Next is to help students focus on the learning side of assessment through self-reflection and formative feedback. -->
<!-- Remind your students that interests as well as intelligence can be developed like a skill. -->
<!-- If possible, give opportunities for self-reflection into one's interests, values, skills, occupational knowledge, and the future of work with the goal of discovering a self-purpose. This could especially serve students who have a limited ideas of their possibilities. -->
<!-- Finally, use a balance of language for both passion and purpose so your students can find something meaningful in whichever feels most appropriate for them at that time in their lives. -->
